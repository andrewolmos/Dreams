  <h1><center>Role Model</center><h1>
  <p> My role model is Pete Parsons because he created one of my most favorite game, Destiny, and I still play that game to this day. He is the also the CEO of the company that I want to work for, Bungie. One of the dreams that he accomplished that I have for myself is creating a game that everyone can enjoy.
